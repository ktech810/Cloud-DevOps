This project will be focused around deploying and hosting a simple React App and observing any auto-changes from Amplify whenever any code changes are made.

---
First I created a simple React application using the command:

<b>npm create vite@latest notesapp -- --template react</b>

I created a repository in Git then added all my code and artifacts

I then signed into my AWS account and connected my recently created Github Repo to AWS Amplify. Doing so enables me to build, deploy and host my app on AWS.

And after waiting a few minutes, I'm able to access the URL given from Amplify that directly points to the URL that hosts my React app from the beginning.

And when I make any code changes locally on my app ("Hello from Amplify"), I see that Amplify automatically updates those changes and reflects them. Really cool!
